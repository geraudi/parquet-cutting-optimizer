# Design Document

## Overview

The GitHub CI/CD pipeline will be implemented using GitHub Actions workflows that automatically trigger on push and pull request events. The design leverages the existing turbo monorepo setup, pnpm package manager, and vitest testing framework to provide fast, reliable continuous integration.

## Architecture

### Workflow Structure
- **Main Workflow**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Primary CI pipeline
- **Trigger Events**: Push to any branch, pull request creation/updates
- **Job Strategy**: Parallel execution where possible, with dependency management
- **Caching Strategy**: Multi-layer caching for dependencies and turbo cache

### Pipeline Stages
1. **Setup & Dependencies**: Install Node.js, pnpm, and dependencies
2. **Code Quality**: Run linting and type checking
3. **Testing**: Execute all tests using turbo and vitest
4. **Build Verification**: Ensure the project builds successfully

## Components and Interfaces

### GitHub Actions Workflow Configuration

#### Job: `ci`
- **Runner**: `ubuntu-latest` (fast, cost-effective)
- **Node Version**: 20.x (matches project requirement)
- **Package Manager**: pnpm (matches project setup)

#### Steps Breakdown:
1. **Checkout Code**: `actions/checkout@v4`
2. **Setup Node.js**: `actions/setup-node@v4` with caching
3. **Setup pnpm**: `pnpm/action-setup@v4`
4. **Install Dependencies**: `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`
5. **Lint**: `pnpm lint` (turbo-powered)
6. **Type Check**: `pnpm check-types` (turbo-powered)
7. **Test**: `pnpm test` (turbo-powered)
8. **Build**: `pnpm build` (turbo-powered)

### Caching Strategy

#### Node Modules Cache
- **Key**: Based on `pnpm-lock.yaml` hash
- **Paths**: `~/.pnpm-store`, `node_modules`
- **Benefit**: Faster dependency installation

#### Turbo Cache
- **Key**: Based on turbo.json and source files
- **Paths**: `.turbo`
- **Benefit**: Skip unchanged package builds/tests

### Turbo Integration

#### Task Configuration Updates
The existing `turbo.json` will be enhanced to include:
- `test` task configuration
- Proper dependency chains
- Cache optimization for CI environment

#### Parallel Execution
Turbo will automatically:
- Run tasks in parallel where dependencies allow
- Cache results for unchanged packages
- Only run affected package tests when possible

## Data Models

### Workflow Configuration Schema
```yaml
name: CI
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  ci:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps: [...]
```

### Turbo Task Configuration
```json
{
  "tasks": {
    "test": {
      "dependsOn": ["^build"],
      "outputs": ["coverage/**"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Error Handling

### Failure Scenarios
1. **Dependency Installation Failure**
   - Retry mechanism through GitHub Actions
   - Clear error messaging for lockfile issues

2. **Lint/Type Check Failures**
   - Fail fast to provide quick feedback
   - Detailed error output for debugging

3. **Test Failures**
   - Continue running all tests to show complete picture
   - Generate test reports for analysis

4. **Build Failures**
   - Stop pipeline immediately
   - Provide build logs for debugging

### Status Reporting
- **Success**: Green checkmark on commits/PRs
- **Failure**: Red X with link to failed job
- **In Progress**: Yellow circle during execution

## Testing Strategy

### CI Pipeline Testing
1. **Local Validation**: Test workflow locally using `act` or similar tools
2. **Branch Testing**: Test on feature branch before merging
3. **Incremental Rollout**: Start with basic workflow, add complexity

### Test Coverage Integration
- Leverage existing vitest setup
- Maintain test coverage reporting
- Ensure all packages with tests are included

### Performance Monitoring
- Track CI pipeline duration
- Monitor cache hit rates
- Optimize based on execution patterns

## Implementation Considerations

### Security
- Use official GitHub Actions
- Pin action versions for reproducibility
- Minimal permissions for workflow token

### Scalability
- Designed to handle monorepo growth
- Turbo caching reduces execution time as repo grows
- Parallel job execution for efficiency

### Maintenance
- Regular updates to action versions
- Monitor for deprecated features
- Documentation for team onboarding

### Integration Points
- **Existing Scripts**: Reuse all existing package.json scripts
- **Turbo Configuration**: Extend current turbo.json setup
- **Testing Framework**: Work with existing vitest configuration
- **Linting**: Use existing ESLint configuration
