# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline that automatically runs tests, linting, and type checking on every git push to ensure code quality and prevent broken code from being merged. The pipeline will leverage the existing turbo monorepo setup and testing infrastructure to provide fast, reliable continuous integration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want tests to run automatically on every git push, so that I can catch issues early and maintain code quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer pushes code to any branch THEN the CI pipeline SHALL execute all tests using the existing test scripts
2. WHEN tests fail THEN the CI pipeline SHALL fail and provide clear error messages
3. WHEN tests pass THEN the CI pipeline SHALL complete successfully with a green status
4. WHEN the CI pipeline runs THEN it SHALL use the same test commands that developers use locally (`pnpm test`)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want linting and type checking to run automatically on git push, so that code style and type safety are enforced consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed THEN the CI pipeline SHALL run linting using the existing lint scripts
2. WHEN code is pushed THEN the CI pipeline SHALL run type checking using TypeScript
3. WHEN linting or type checking fails THEN the CI pipeline SHALL fail with descriptive error messages
4. WHEN linting and type checking pass THEN the CI pipeline SHALL continue to the next steps

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the CI pipeline to be fast and efficient, so that I don't have to wait long for feedback on my changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the CI pipeline runs THEN it SHALL leverage turbo's caching capabilities for faster builds
2. WHEN the CI pipeline runs THEN it SHALL use pnpm for efficient dependency management
3. WHEN the CI pipeline runs THEN it SHALL run jobs in parallel where possible
4. WHEN dependencies haven't changed THEN the CI pipeline SHALL use cached node_modules

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a team lead, I want the CI pipeline to run on pull requests, so that code review includes automated quality checks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a pull request is opened THEN the CI pipeline SHALL run automatically
2. WHEN a pull request is updated with new commits THEN the CI pipeline SHALL run again
3. WHEN the CI pipeline fails on a PR THEN the PR status SHALL show as failing
4. WHEN the CI pipeline passes on a PR THEN the PR status SHALL show as passing

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the CI pipeline to work with the existing monorepo structure, so that all packages are tested appropriately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the CI pipeline runs THEN it SHALL test all packages in the monorepo using turbo
2. WHEN changes affect specific packages THEN turbo SHALL only run tests for affected packages and their dependents
3. WHEN the web app has tests THEN the CI pipeline SHALL run vitest tests
4. WHEN packages have different test setups THEN the CI pipeline SHALL handle each appropriately
