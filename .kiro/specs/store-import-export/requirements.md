# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables users to backup and restore their parquet cutting optimizer configurations by downloading the current Zustand store state as a JSON file and uploading previously saved configurations to restore their work. This addresses the need for data portability, backup capabilities, and sharing configurations between devices or with other users.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to download my current room and strip configuration as a JSON file, so that I can backup my work and share it with others.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks a "Download Configuration" button THEN the system SHALL generate a JSON file containing the current store state
2. WHEN the JSON file is generated THEN the system SHALL automatically trigger a browser download with a descriptive filename including timestamp
3. WHEN the download occurs THEN the JSON file SHALL contain all persisted store data including roomSize, stripWidth, stripLengths, and totalLength
4. IF the store is empty or has default values THEN the system SHALL still allow download with the current state

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload a previously saved configuration JSON file, so that I can restore my work or load configurations from other sources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects a JSON file through a file input THEN the system SHALL validate the file format and structure
2. IF the uploaded file has valid JSON structure matching the store schema THEN the system SHALL replace the current store state with the uploaded data
3. IF the uploaded file is invalid or corrupted THEN the system SHALL display an error message and not modify the current store
4. WHEN a valid configuration is loaded THEN the system SHALL update all UI components to reflect the new state
5. WHEN a configuration is successfully imported THEN the system SHALL persist the new state to localStorage

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear visual feedback during import/export operations, so that I understand the status of my actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an import/export operation is in progress THEN the system SHALL display appropriate loading indicators
2. WHEN an operation completes successfully THEN the system SHALL show a success message
3. WHEN an operation fails THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message explaining what went wrong
4. WHEN importing a file THEN the system SHALL show a preview or summary of what will be imported before applying changes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the import/export functionality to be easily accessible, so that I can quickly backup or restore my configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user is on the main application page THEN the system SHALL display clearly labeled import and export buttons
2. WHEN the user hovers over the buttons THEN the system SHALL show tooltips explaining their functionality
3. WHEN the user clicks export THEN the system SHALL immediately start the download process
4. WHEN the user clicks import THEN the system SHALL open a file selection dialog

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the import/export functionality to be type-safe and maintainable, so that it remains reliable as the store schema evolves.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL use TypeScript interfaces to ensure type safety
2. WHEN importing data THEN the system SHALL validate the imported data against the expected schema
3. IF the store schema changes in the future THEN the system SHALL handle backward compatibility gracefully
4. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages about which fields are invalid
