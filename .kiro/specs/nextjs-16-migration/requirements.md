# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for migrating the web application from Next.js 15.5.4 to Next.js 16. The migration involves upgrading the framework version, updating configuration files, handling breaking changes, and ensuring all existing functionality continues to work properly.

## Glossary

- **Web_Application**: The Next.js application located in apps/web directory
- **Migration_Process**: The systematic upgrade from Next.js 15.5.4 to Next.js 16
- **Breaking_Changes**: API changes that require code modifications to maintain functionality
- **Configuration_Files**: next.config.mjs and other Next.js configuration files
- **Dependencies**: All npm packages that depend on or interact with Next.js
- **Build_System**: The compilation and bundling process for the application
- **Development_Server**: The local development environment using next dev
- **Production_Build**: The optimized build for deployment using next build

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to upgrade to Next.js 16, so that I can access the latest features and improvements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Migration_Process is initiated, THE Web_Application SHALL upgrade to Next.js 16 latest stable version
2. THE Web_Application SHALL maintain all existing functionality after the upgrade
3. THE Build_System SHALL compile successfully with Next.js 16
4. THE Development_Server SHALL start without errors using Next.js 16
5. THE Production_Build SHALL generate successfully with Next.js 16

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all breaking changes to be handled properly, so that the application continues to work without issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Breaking_Changes are identified, THE Migration_Process SHALL update affected code accordingly
2. THE Web_Application SHALL handle async API changes for params, searchParams, cookies, and headers
3. THE Configuration_Files SHALL be updated to use Next.js 16 compatible settings
4. THE Web_Application SHALL remove or replace any deprecated APIs
5. THE Web_Application SHALL update image optimization settings if required

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all dependencies to be compatible with Next.js 16, so that there are no version conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Dependencies SHALL be updated to versions compatible with Next.js 16
2. THE Web_Application SHALL resolve any peer dependency conflicts
3. THE Dependencies SHALL include React 19 compatibility updates if required
4. THE Web_Application SHALL update TypeScript types for Next.js 16
5. THE Web_Application SHALL maintain compatibility with the monorepo workspace structure

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the migration to be tested thoroughly, so that I can be confident the upgrade is successful.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Web_Application SHALL pass all existing tests after migration
2. THE Development_Server SHALL run without console errors or warnings
3. THE Web_Application SHALL render all pages correctly in development mode
4. THE Production_Build SHALL complete without build errors
5. THE Web_Application SHALL maintain performance characteristics similar to the previous version

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear documentation of changes made during migration, so that I understand what was modified.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Migration_Process SHALL document all configuration changes made
2. THE Migration_Process SHALL document all code changes required for compatibility
3. THE Migration_Process SHALL document any new features or capabilities available
4. THE Migration_Process SHALL document any deprecated features that were removed
5. THE Migration_Process SHALL provide guidance on testing the migrated application
