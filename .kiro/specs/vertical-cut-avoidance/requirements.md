# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the parquet cutting optimizer to prevent vertical alignment of cuts between adjacent rows. When strips are cut to fit within a room's width, the cuts should be staggered to avoid creating weak points and maintain visual appeal in the parquet layout. This constraint ensures that cuts in consecutive rows are offset by a minimum distance to prevent structural weakness and improve the overall aesthetic of the flooring pattern.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a flooring installer, I want the cutting optimizer to avoid aligning cuts vertically between adjacent rows, so that the parquet maintains structural integrity and visual appeal.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calculating strip placement for a new row THEN the system SHALL ensure no cut aligns vertically with cuts in the previous row within a minimum offset distance
2. WHEN a cut would create vertical alignment THEN the system SHALL adjust strip selection or positioning to maintain the minimum offset
3. WHEN multiple strip arrangements are possible THEN the system SHALL prioritize arrangements that maximize cut offset distances

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user configuring the layout algorithm, I want to specify the minimum offset distance for cuts, so that I can control the staggering pattern based on my specific requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the algorithm THEN the system SHALL accept a minimum cut offset parameter (default 20cm)
2. IF no minimum offset is specified THEN the system SHALL use a default value of 30cm
3. WHEN the minimum offset is set THEN the system SHALL validate it is a positive number greater than 0

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer using the calculator, I want the vertical cut avoidance to work seamlessly with existing constraints, so that all layout rules are respected simultaneously.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN applying vertical cut avoidance THEN the system SHALL maintain existing constraints (minimum strip length, cut size limitations)
2. WHEN vertical cut avoidance conflicts with other constraints THEN the system SHALL prioritize structural requirements over cut positioning
3. WHEN no valid arrangement exists with cut avoidance THEN the system SHALL fall back to the original algorithm and log a warning

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a quality assurance tester, I want the system to validate that vertical cut alignment is properly avoided, so that I can verify the algorithm works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a room layout is calculated THEN the system SHALL validate that no cuts are vertically aligned within the minimum offset distance
2. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed information about which cuts are misaligned
3. WHEN validation passes THEN the system SHALL confirm successful cut staggering in the result metadata
